## Introduction

Vercel, formerly ZEIT, is an american cloud platform designed to streamline the deployment process for web applications.

The company is also well known for creating the Next.js react framework.

Some of Vercel's features:

- **Infrastructure and security:** Vercel utilizes an Edge Network for intelligent traffic routing near users, offering dynamic scalability while ensuring default security through isolated request handling and global content replication for stability.
- **Instant deployment:** Vercel enables instant deployment by connecting directly to GIT repositories. When developers push new code trough GIT, Vercel automatically detects changes and deploys the updated version without manual intervention.
- **The native Next.js platform:** Vercel's platform is made by the creators of Next.js, so Next.js applications will have multiple advantages when deployed to Vercel compared to other hosting solutions.

|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Infrastructure and security | Optimizes performance via global server network. |
| Instant deployment          | Automatically deploys changes from Git repos.    |

## Market Comparison

Compared to other hosting platforms, Vercel stands out for its seamless integration with version control systems, automated deployment, and its focus on simplicity.

Next.js is a very popular react framework with big advantages over vanilla react, Vercel has many big advantages with Next.js applications that the competition does not have because the developers behind Vercel is the same as Next.js.

There are many advantages to using Vercel as your hosting platform:

- Easy-to-use user interface
- Easy integration with backend
- Real-time collaboration with your teammates
- Preview builds live and test automatically
- Smart features like Edge functions, analytics, AI integrations
- The Next.js native platform
- Free domain name
- Free for personal use with unlimited projects

Of course as with everything there are some downsides:

- Can be expensive for bigger and more used applications
- Limited support for databases and backend services prevents them from creating more sophisticated applications
- Interface and documentation to be overly complex, especially for beginners or non-technical users.

## Conclusion

Vercel packs a lot of great features that no other competitors have and has a really good free tier.

My focus for this case study was mostly on using Vercel as a hosting platform for a private developer, since that is where most of my experience lies. 

If someone where to only deploy an simple application without any extensive configuration, analytics or frequent redeploy i would also recommend Netlify. 

But if you are interested in using any of Vercel´s features and for an example deploy a Next.js application i would greatly recommend using Vercel.

I believe that the features and possibility of Vercel is outweighing some of the downsides like it's complex documentation and interface.
